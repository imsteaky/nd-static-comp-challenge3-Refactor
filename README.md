Static Comp 3 Challenge for Turing // Refactored 

My first pass through the Static Comp Challenge 3 was done in a ludicrously short amount of time, and it showed at every point (and break) of the completed product. Given extra time to fix its responsiveness (and everything else) I fixed my layout and 
applied my knowledge of CSS grid properly. The differences between the two are night and day.

We were instructed to create the following layout.

This was the first attempt.
